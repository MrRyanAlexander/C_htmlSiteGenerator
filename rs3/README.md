This a C program to generate random websites. 

The directory structure here r0-r3 refer to versions 
and this directory - the main - is the current version

From the terminal issue "./a.out"

The code will fetch data from the lists provided and try
to randomly generate a website based on that data. 

The number of generated sites is small, but can easily be increased

The purpose of this program was to practice learning C programming, 
but as it turns out, most of it is more C++ than true C.
